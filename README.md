How to Clone the Repository
To clone a copy of the repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal:

On macOS or Linux, you can use the Terminal application.
On Windows, you can use Git Bash or the Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the desired directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:

Bash
cd Documents/Projects
Use code with caution.
3. Clone the repository using HTTPS:

Run the following command, replacing <username> and <repository_name> with your actual details:

Bash
git clone [https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>.git](https://github.com/Sonkarrushikesh22/Tax_calculator.git)
